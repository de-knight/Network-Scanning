# **Understanding Network Scanning:**

- **What is Network Scanning?**
Network scanning is a critical process used to gather essential information about a network and its associated services. This process involves actively communicating with the target system to identify key components such as IP addresses and hostnames, open ports, and the specific services running on those ports. By systematically scanning the network, security professionals can pinpoint live hosts and detect vulnerable services that may be exposed to potential threats. Understanding these aspects is vital for assessing the security posture of the network and implementing effective measures to protect it from unauthorized access and attacks.
