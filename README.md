# **Understanding Network Scanning:**

+ **What is Network Scanning?**

Network scanning is a critical process used to gather essential information about a network and its associated services. This process involves actively communicating with the target system to identify key components such as IP addresses and hostnames, open ports, and the specific services running on those ports. By systematically scanning the network, security professionals can pinpoint live hosts and detect vulnerable services that may be exposed to potential threats. Understanding these aspects is vital for assessing the security posture of the network and implementing effective measures to protect it from unauthorized access and attacks.

+ **Types of Scanning**

Different scanning methods are used to find hosts, ports, and services in a target network. Some of the most common scanning techniques are well-known for their effectiveness. Each method has its own strengths, helping security experts choose the best way to analyze a network based on their specific needs.

+ **Network Scanning**

During network scanning, attackers create a list of active IP addresses of computers on the target network. By understanding the layout of the network and the services running on each computer, attackers can more easily identify potential weaknesses to exploit.
